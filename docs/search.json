Her research describes pre-colonization forest structure and composition in California, focusing on stand density as a measurement of competitive stress, and relates that information to contemporary forestry regulations and practices to inform forest management. Connie hopes to continue working on research that draws on ecology and forestry to both understand forests and support their health through ecologically-inspired adaptive management.\nUniversity of California, Berkeley | Berkeley, CA\nB.S., Ecosystem Management & Forestry | August 2019 - May 2023"
